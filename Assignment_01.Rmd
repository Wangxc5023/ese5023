# 1 Flowchart 

**[5 points]** Write a function `Print_values` with arguments `a`, `b`, and `c` to reflect the following flowchart [^1]. Here the purple parallelpgram operator is to print values in order. Show you output with some random `a`, `b`, and `c` values.

# 2 Matrix multiplication

**2.1 [5 points]** Make two matrices `M1` (`5` rows and `10` columns ) and `M2` (`10` rows and `5` columns ), both are filled with random integers from `0` and `50`.

**2.2 [5 points]** Write a function `Matrix_multip` to do matrix multiplication, *i.e.*, `M1 * M2`. Here you are only allowed to use `for` loop, `*` operator, and `+` operator. Check your result with the `%*%` operator.

# 3 Pascal triangle

**[15 points]** One of the most interesting number patterns is [Pascal's triangle](https://www.mathsisfun.com/pascals-triangle.html) (named after Blaise Pascal). Write a function `Pascal_triangle` with an arguement `N` to print the first *N* lines of the Pascal triangle. Report `Pascal_triangle(100)` and `Pascal_triangle(200)`.

# 5. Add or double the money

**[20 points]** If you start with 1 RMB and, with each move, you can either double your money or add another 1 RMB, what is the smallest number of moves you have to make to get to exactly *N* RMB? Here *N* is randomly seleted from `100` to `200`. Write a function `Smallest_number` to print your results. For example, `Smallest_number(2)` should print `2`, and `Smallest_number(5)` should print `3`.

# 4 Dynamic programming

Insert `+` or `-` operation anywhere between the digits `123456789` in a way that the expression evaluates to a integer number. You may join digits together to form a bigger number. However, the digits must stay in the original order. For example:
$$ 1 - 2 + 34 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 - 9 = 50 $$
$$ 1 + 2 + 34 - 56 + 78 - 9 = 50 $$
**1.1 [20 points]** Write a function `Find_expression`, which should be able to print every possible solution that makes the expression evaluate to a random integer from `0` to `200`. 

**1.2 [5 points]** Count the total number of suitable solutions for any integer *i* from `0` to `200`, assign the count to `Total_solutions[i]`. Plot the vector `Total_solutions` as the y-axis and the sequence from `0` to `200` as the x-axis. 

(Hint: You may find `seq()`, `choose()`, and `permutations()` useful)

# 5 Visibility in Shenzhen during the past 10 years

In this problem set, we will examine how visibility behaviros in Shenzhen during the past 10 years. Recall the `2281305.csv` you used for [Exercise #3](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese5023/Section_03.html#Exercise_3) in Section 03. Hourly visibility data are stored under the `VIS` column. Read page `10` of the comprehensive [user guide](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-hourly/doc/isd-format-document.pdf) for detailed format of the data.

You want to only use data points meet the following criteria:

* Visibility data (in meters) within the range of `0` and `160000`
* Pass all quality control checks: `VISIBILITY-OBSERVATION distance quality code` is `1`, `VISIBILITY-OBSERVATION variability code` is `N`, and `VISIBILITY-OBSERVATION quality variability code` is `1`.

**5.1 [15 points]** Plot hourly visibility data as a function of the observation time, simalir to the timeseries plot you made in [Exercise #3](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese5023/Section_03.html#Exercise_3). Based on your naked eyes, is there a trend in visibility in the past 10 years? 

**5.2 [10 points]** For each year, report the number of days with visibility shorter than `5km` and longer than `25km`. Is the visibility getting better or worse?
