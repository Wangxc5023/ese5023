# Instructions  

**Collaboration:**  
Collaboration on solving the assignment is allowed, after you have thought about the problem sets on your own. It is also OK to get clarification (but not solutions) from online resources, again after you have thought about the problem sets on your own. There are two requirements: 

* Cite your collaborators **fully and completely** (*e.g.*, "XXX explained to me what is asked in problem set 3"). Or cite online resources (*e.g.*, "I got inspired by reading XXX") that helped you.

* Write your scripts and report **independently** - the scripts and report must come from you only.

**Submitting your assignment:**  

* Please write a report `PS1.pdf`. 

* For problem set *i*, create a script named `PS1_i.py`. 

* Upload your `Python` scripts **AND** report to your Github `ESE5023_Assignments_XXX` repository (where `XXX` is your SUSTech ID) before the due time.

**Late Submission:**   
Late submissions will not receive any credit. The submission time will be determined based on your latest GitHub file records.

# 1. Flowchart 

**[10 points]** Write a function `Print_values` with arguments `a`, `b`, and `c` to reflect the following flowchart. Here the red-ish parallelogram operator is to print values in the given order. Report your output with some random `a`, `b`, and `c` values.

# 2. Matrix multiplication

**2.1 [5 points]** Make two matrices `M1` (`5` rows and `10` columns ) and `M2` (`10` rows and `5` columns ); both are filled with random integers from `0` and `50`.

**2.2 [10 points]** Write a function `Matrix_multip` to do matrix multiplication, *i.e.*, `M1 * M2`. Here you are **ONLY** allowed to use `for` loop, `*` operator, and `+` operator. 

***

# 3. Pascal triangle

**[20 points]** One of the most interesting number patterns is [Pascal's triangle](https://www.mathsisfun.com/pascals-triangle.html) (named after Blaise Pascal). Write a function `Pascal_triangle` with an argument `k` to print the *k*^th^ line of the Pascal triangle. Report `Pascal_triangle(100)` and `Pascal_triangle(200)`.

***

# 4. Add or double

**[20 points]** If you start with `1` RMB and, with each move, you can either double your money or add another `1` RMB, what is the smallest number of moves you have to make to get to exactly *x* RMB? Here *x* is an integer randomly selected from `1` to `100`. Write a function `Least_moves` to print your results. For example, `Least_moves(2)` should print `1`, and `Least_moves(5)` should print `3`.

***

# 5. Dynamic programming

Insert `+` or `-` operation anywhere between the digits `123456789` in a way that the expression evaluates to an integer number. You may join digits together to form a bigger number. However, the digits must stay in the original order. 

**5.1 [30 points]** Write a function `Find_expression`, which should be able to print every possible solution that makes the expression evaluate to a random integer from `1` to `100`. For example, `Find_expression(50)` should print lines include:
$$ 1 - 2 + 34 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 - 9 = 50 $$
and
$$ 1 + 2 + 34 - 56 + 78 - 9 = 50 $$

**5.2 [5 points]** Count the total number of suitable solutions for any integer *i* from `1` to `100`, assign the count to a list called `Total_solutions`. Plot the list `Total_solutions`, so which number(s) yields the maximum and minimum of `Total_solutions`?
