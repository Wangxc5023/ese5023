> "I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships." - Linus Torvalds

# Keeling Curve

<img src="figs/mlo_record.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>

[Charles David Keeling](https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/history_legacy/charles_david_keeling_biography.html) directed a program to measure the concentrations of CO~2~ in the atmosphere that continued without interruption from the late 1950's through the present. This program, operated out of [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu), is responsible for the Mauna Loa record, which is almost certainly the ***best-known icon*** illustrating the impact of humanity on the planet as a whole. [^1] 

We will use [monthly CO~2~ data](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/data.html) measured from Mauna Loa in this section. 

To begin with, download the `co2_mm_mlo.csv` file from [here](). And save it to your `working directory`.
