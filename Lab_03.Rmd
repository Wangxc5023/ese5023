# 1. Flowchart

A [Flowchart](https://www.programiz.com/article/flowchart-programming) is a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm. It can be helpful for both writing programs and explaining the program to others. A Flowchart is very useful in programming, as it explains a process clearly through symbols and text. Moreover, a flowchart gives you the gist of the process flow in a single glance. 

Here we begin to learn the flowchart with `if` and `else` in `Python`. Copy the following lines into your script:

```{python eval=FALSE}
# importing "random" for random operations
import random

# Using random() function to generate one random value between 0 and 1
Score  = round(random.random()*100)
print(Score)

# Get level
if (Score >= 90):
  print("Excellent") 
elif (Score >= 60):
  print("Pass")
else:
  print("Fail")
```

* Selecting all the lines, and then run the script, what is your result in **Console**?  Here `Score` is randomly generated using `random()` function from the `random` library. Type `help(random)` for help. You can play with this script a few times to get different outputs.

* Draw a flow chart based on this script.  

* Update your script to reflect the following flowchart.

# 2. Building a guessing game

+ Set a secret integer from `0` to `9`, name the integer `answer`. Make sure your deskmate does not know the secret number.

+ Write a function that does the following: if your deskmate is able to guess your secret number correctly, print `You Win!`, otherwise print `You Lose! I Win!`

+ Let your deskmate play the game. 

+ Now it's your turn to play your deskmate's game.
