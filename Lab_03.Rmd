# 1. More about the gapminder data

In this exercise, we will take another look at the `gapminder` data used in [Lab 02](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese5023/Lab_02.html) by conducting a few more statistical tests. The goal is to strengthen your skills in data wrangling and statistical sleuth.

**1.1** Install the `gapminder` package if you haven't. Then load the data by:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load the gapminder library
library(gapminder)
```

**1.2** Plot boxplots of the life expectancy (`lifeExp`) in 1957 for 5 continents side-by-side. Is there evidence that the mean life expectancies is different for the different continents? 

**1.3** Repeat **1.2**, but for a different year of 2007. Compare the boxplots from **1.2** and **1.3**, which continent has the witnessed the biggest improvement in mean life expectancy?

**1.4** You probably figured out that the improvement in mean life expectancy is the biggest in Asia from 1957 to 2007. Can you estimate such improvement?

**1.5** Generate a `tibble` named `gapminder_new`, which contains mean life expectancy (`mean_lifeExp`) and mean GDP per capita (`mean_gdpPercap`) in each country, both are averaged from 1957 to 2007. Plot a scatter plot with `mean_lifeExp` as the Y-axis and `mean_lifeExp` as the X-axis. 

**1.6** Based on the scatter plot from **1.5**, can we fit a simple linear regression model to the two variables? Why or why not?

**1.7** Fitting a simple linear regression model requires linearity between the two variables. Apparently, such an assumption is not met by examining the plot from **1.6**. This is because `mean_gdpPercap` does not follow a normal distribution, instead it follows a *log-normal distribution*. The log-normal distribution is characterized with a long tail towards high values. Use the `hist()` function to verify `mean_gdpPercap` has a long tail. Environmental data often follow log-normal distributions.

**1.8** We often transfer a log-normal distribution to a normal distribution by using logarithmic calculations. Now take `log` on `mean_gdpPercap`, and assign the results to a new vector `mean_gdpPercap_log`. Check the distribution of `mean_gdpPercap_log`.

**1.9** Plot a scatter plot with `mean_lifeExp` as the Y-axis and `mean_gdpPercap_log` as the X-axis. Describe what you see.

**1.10** As both `mean_gdpPercap_log` and `mean_lifeExp` are roughly following normal distributions now, we can finally build a linear model between `mean_lifeExp` and `mean_gdpPercap_log`. Fit a simple linear regression model between `mean_lifeExp` and `mean_gdpPercap_log`, and add the regression line to the scatter plot from **1.9**. Estimate the improvement in life expectancy as GDP per capita increases by 1 unit.

**1.11**  Split `gapminder_new` to two subsets - `gapminder_new_train` (with 85% data points) and `gapminder_new_test` (with 15% data points). Following **1.10**, build a linear model (named as `model_log`) between `mean_gdpPercap_log` and `mean_lifeExp` using data from `gapminder_new_train`. 

**1.12** Apply the fitted linear model `model_log` to `gapminder_new_test` subset, get predicted life expectancies using the `predict()` function. Compare predicted life expectancies with actual values in `gapminder_new_test` in terms of correlation coefficients and relative mean bias.
