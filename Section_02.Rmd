# Why R?

[^1]: [Why use the R Language?](https://www.burns-stat.com/documents/tutorials/why-use-the-r-language/)

R is the leading tool for statistics, data analysis, and machine learning.  It is more than a statistical package; it’s a ***programming language***, so you can create your own objects, functions, and packages. [^2]  

[^2]: [Why Use R?](https://www.r-bloggers.com/why-use-r/)

Academics and statisticians have developed R over two decades. R has now one of the richest ecosystems to perform data analysis. There are around ***16000 packages*** available in CRAN ([Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/)). It is possible to find a library for ***whatever the analysis*** you want to perform. The rich variety of library makes R the first choice for statistical and data analysis. R also makes communicating the findings with a presentation, document, or website very easy. [^3]
