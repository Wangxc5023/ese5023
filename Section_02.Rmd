# Why R?

[^1]: [Why use the R Language?](https://www.burns-stat.com/documents/tutorials/why-use-the-r-language/)

R is the leading tool for statistics, data analysis, and machine learning.  It is more than a statistical package; it’s a ***programming language***, so you can create your own objects, functions, and packages. [^2]  

[^2]: [Why Use R?](https://www.r-bloggers.com/why-use-r/)

Academics and statisticians have developed R over two decades. R has now one of the richest ecosystems to perform data analysis. There are around ***16000 packages*** available in CRAN ([Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/)). It is possible to find a library for ***whatever the analysis*** you want to perform. The rich variety of library makes R the first choice for statistical and data analysis. R also makes communicating the findings with a presentation, document, or website very easy. [^3]

# First look at RStudio

The RStudio IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the most popular integrated development environment for R. It allows you to write, run, and debug your own R code.

# Introduction to R

## Using R as a calculator

The simplest thing you could do with R is to do arithmetic, let try this in the **Console** window:

```{r}
1 + 2
```
R will print out the answer, with a preceding `## [1]` or `[1]` in your computer. Don’t worry about this for now, we’ll explain that later. For now think of it as indicating output.  

You will find the spaces have no impact on the result

```{r}
1+2
```

When using R as a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you would have learned back in school. From highest to lowest precedence:

* Parentheses: `(`, `)`
* Exponents: `^` or `**`
* Multiply: `*`
* Divide: `/`
* Add: `+`
* Subtract: `-`

Let's try

```{r}
1 + 2 * 3
```

```{r}
(1 + 2) * 3
```

```{r}
(1 + 2) ^ 3
```

Always think about clarifing your intentions, as others may later read your code. Here we call such intentions as “comments”. Anything that follows after the hash symbol `#` is ignored by R when it executes code.

```{r}
# Get the square root of 100?
100 ^ 0.5
```

Really small or large numbers get a scientific notation:
```{r}
2 / 10000
```
You can write numbers in scientific notation too:
```{r}
5e+5 * 1e+5
```

## Mathematical functions

R has many built in mathematical functions. To call a function, we can type its name, followed by open and closing parentheses. Anything we type inside the parentheses is called the function’s *arguments*:

```{r}
# Trigonometry functions
sin(1)
sin(0.5*pi)
```

```{r}
# Natural logarithm
log(10)
# Base-10 logarithm
log10(10)
# e^(1/2)
exp(0.5)
```
Don’t worry about trying to remember every function in R. You can look them up online, or if you can remember the start of the function’s name, use the `Tab` completion in RStudio.

This is one advantage that RStudio has over R on its own, it has **auto-completion abilities** that allow you to more easily look up functions, their arguments, and the values that they take.

Typing a `?` before the name of a command will open the help page for that command. When using RStudio, this will open the ‘Help’ pane. The help page will include a detailed description of the command and how it works. Scrolling to the bottom of the help page will usually show a collection of code examples which illustrate command usage. 

## Comparing things

We can also do comparisons in R:

```{r}
# Equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
1 == 1
# Inequality (read as "is not equal to")
3 != 2  
# Less than
100 < 101  
# Less than or equal to
1e3 <= 2e3
# Greater than
1/3 > 1/5
# Greater than or equal to
-100 > -200
```

A word of warning about comparing numbers: you should never use `==` to compare two numbers unless they are integers (a data type which can specifically represent only whole numbers).

Computers may only represent decimal numbers with a certain degree of precision, so two numbers which look the same when printed out by R, may actually have different underlying representations and therefore be different by a small margin of error (called Machine numeric tolerance). Further reading: http://floating-point-gui.de/

Instead you should use the `all.equal` function.

```{r}
# Comparing
all.equal(1, 1)
all.equal(1, 1+1e-5)
```

## Variables and assignment

We can store values in variables using the assignment operator `<-`, like this:

```{r}
# Assignment
x <- 1/100
```
Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored it for later in something called a **variable**. `x` now contains the value `0.01`:
```{r}
# Print x
x
# Or use the function print()
print(x)
```

You can also assign a character to a variable
```{r}
# Print x
MyName <- "SUSTech"
# Or use the function print()
print(MyName)
```

Look for the **Environment** window in the top right panel of RStudio, and you will see that `x` and its value have appeared. Our variable `x` can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number:
```{r}
# Print x
log10(x)
```
Notice also that variables can be reassigned:
```{r}
# Assignment
x <- 100
```
`x` used to contain the value `0.01` and now it has the value `100`.

Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to:
```{r}
# Notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
x <- x + 1 
y <- x * 2
```
The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression. The right hand side is *fully evaluated* before the assignment occurs.

Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods **but no spaces**. They must start with a letter or a period followed by a letter (they cannot start with a number nor an underscore). Variables begining with a period are hidden variables. Different people use different conventions for long variable names. Whatever you use is up to you, but be consistent.

## Vectorization

One thing to be aware of is that R is *vectorized*, meaning that variables and functions can have vectors as values. In contrast to physics and mathematics, a vector in R describes a set of values in a certain order of the same data type. For example

```{r}
1:10
2^(1:10)
x <- 1:10
2^x
```
This is incredibly powerful; we will discuss this further in an upcoming lesson.

## Managing your environment

There are a few useful commands you can use to interact with the R session.

`ls` will list all of the variables and functions stored in the global environment (your working R session):

```{r}
ls()
```

Note here that we didn’t give any arguments to `ls`, but we still needed to give the parentheses to tell R to call the function.

You can use `rm` to delete objects you no longer need:
```{r}
rm(x)
ls()
```

## Conditional statements 

Often when we’re coding we want to control the flow of our actions. This can be done by setting actions to occur only if a condition or a set of conditions are met. Alternatively, we can also set an action to occur a particular number of times.

There are several ways you can control flow in R. For conditional statements, the most commonly used approaches are the `if` and `else` constructs.

```{r}
x <- 5

if (x >= 10) { # If this condition is TRUE
  # Do following
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} # End of if statement

x
```

The print statement does not appear in the console because `x` is not greater than `10`. To print a different message for numbers less than `10`, we can add an else statement.

```{r}
x <- 5

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than 10")
}
```

You can also test multiple conditions by using `else if`.

```{r}
x <- 5

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else if (x > 3) {
  print("x is greater than 3, but less than 10")
} else {
  print("x is less or equal than 3")
}
```

**Important**: when R evaluates the condition inside `if()` statements, it is looking for a logical element, i.e., `TRUE` or `FALSE`. This can cause some headaches for beginners. For example:

```{r}
x  <-  4 == 3
if (x) {
  "4 equals 3"
} else {
  "4 does not equal 3"          
}
```

## Repeating operations

If you want to iterate over a set of values, when the order of iteration is important, and perform the same operation on each, a `for()` loop will do the job. This is the most flexible of looping operations, but therefore also the hardest to use correctly. In general, the advice of many R users would be to learn about `for()` loops, but to avoid using `for()` loops unless the order of iteration is important: i.e. the calculation at each iteration depends on the results of previous iterations. 
```{r}
for (i in 1:5) { # If this condition is TRUE
  # Do following
  print(i)
} # End of the for loop
```

We can use a for() loop nested within another for() loop to iterate over two things at once.

```{r}
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')) {
    print(paste(i,j))
  }
}
```

We notice in the output that when the first index (`i`) is set to `1`, the second index (`j`) iterates through its full set of indices. Once the indices of `j` have been iterated through, then `i` is incremented. This process continues until the last index has been used for each `for()` loop.

Rather than printing the results, we could write the loop output to a new object.

```{r}
output_vector <- c()
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')) {
    temp_output <- paste(i, j)
    output_vector <- c(output_vector, temp_output)
  }
}
output_vector
```
This approach can be useful, but ‘growing your results’ (building the result object incrementally) is **computationally inefficient**, so avoid it when you are iterating through a lot of values. Here `c()` means "combine":

```{r}
x <- 1
y <- 2
z <- c(x, y)
z
```

**Important**: One of the biggest things that trips up novices and experienced R users alike, is building a results object (vector, list, matrix, data frame) as your for loop progresses. Computers are very bad at handling this, so your calculations can very quickly slow to a crawl. It’s much better to define an **empty results** object before hand of appropriate dimensions, rather than initializing an empty object without dimensions. So if you know the end result will be stored in a matrix like above, create an empty matrix with 5 row and 5 columns, then at each iteration store the results in the appropriate location.

```{r}
output_matrix <- matrix(nrow=5, ncol=5)
j_vector <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in 1:5) {
    temp_j_value <- j_vector[j]
    temp_output <- paste(i, temp_j_value)
    output_matrix[i, j] <- temp_output
  }
}
output_vector2 <- as.vector(output_matrix)
output_vector2
```
Here we use `matrix()` to create  an empty matrix with 5 rows and 5 columns, and use `as.vector()` to convert the 5x5 matrix into a vector.

Sometimes you will find yourself needing to repeat an operation as long as a certain condition is met. You can do this with a `while()` loop.

```{r}
z <- 0
while(z <= 5 ){ # While this condition is TRUE
  # Do following
  z <- z + 1
  print(z)
} # End of the while loop
```

OK, can you figure out why the number `6` is also printed?

`while()` loops will not always be appropriate. You have to be **particularly careful** that you don’t end up stuck in an infinite loop because your condition is always met and hence the while statement never terminates.

## R Packages

It is possible to add functions to R by writing a **package**, or by obtaining a package written by someone else. As of this writing, there are over 16,000 packages available on CRAN (the comprehensive R archive network). RStudio have functionality for managing packages. You can:

* See what packages are installed by typing `installed.packages()`
* Install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`, where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
* Update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
* Remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
* Make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`, no quotes.

Packages can also be viewed, loaded, and detached in the Packages tab of the lower right panel in RStudio. 

<img src="figs/packages.jpg" alt="drawing" width="800"/>

Clicking on this tab will displas all of installed packages with a checkbox next to them. If the box next to a package name is checked, the package is loaded and if it is empty, the package is not loaded. Click an empty box to load that package and click a checked box to detach that package.

Packages can be installed and updated from the Package tab with the Install and Update buttons at the top of the tab.
