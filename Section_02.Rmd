# A brief introduction to Linux 

Linux is an operating system (OS) built by Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki in 1991. The name "Linux" comes from the Linux kernel.   

Linux has survived so long because it’s **a power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes**. More importantly, it helps them **combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks** so they aren’t typing the same things over and over again. Use of Linux ***shell*** is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources, including high-performance computing (HPC) supercomputers [^1].   

As Linux lovers put it:  

> One OS to rule them all,  
One OS to find them.  
One OS to call them all,  
And in salvation bind them.  
In the bright land of Linux,  
Where the hackers play.   

These lessons will start you on a path towards using Linux and Shell on the TaiYi HPC supercomputer.

You need to download some files to follow this lesson:    

1. Copy `data-shell.tar.xz` to your home folder using `cp`.
2. Extract the file by `tar -xvf shell-novice-data.tar.xz`.

# Navigating Files and Directories

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories. To start exploring them, let's open a shell window. 

The dollar sign `$` is a **prompt**, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input; your shell may use a different character as a prompt and may add information before the prompt.

Next, let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd` (which stands for "print working directory"). At any moment, our **current working directory** is our current default directory, i.e., the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in unless we explicitly specify something else. Here, the computer's response is `/data/ese5023`, which is my **home directory**:


```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine='sh'}
pwd
```
```{bash, eval=TRUE, engine='sh'}
pwd
```


```{bash}
cd /work/ZHU
pwd
ls
```

In your case, it should be something like `/work/XXX`, which is your **home directory**.

Now let's learn the command that will let us see the contents of our own filesystem. We can see what's in my home directory by running `ls`, which stands for "listing":

```{bash}
cd /work/ZHU
ls
```

`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in alphabetical order, arranged neatly into columns. We can make its output more comprehensible by using the **flag** `-F`, which tells `ls` to add a trailing `/` to the names of directories:
```{bash}
cd /work/ZHU
ls -F
```

`ls` has lots of other options. To find out what they are, we can type: `man ls`.

`man` is the Unix "manual" command: it prints a description of a command and its options, and (if you're lucky) provides a few examples of how to use it. To navigate through the `man` pages, you may use the up and down arrow keys to move line-by-line, or try the "b" and spacebar keys to skip up and down by full page. Quit the `man` pages by typing "q".

Here, we can see that my working directory contains mostly **sub-directories**. Any names in the output that don't have trailing slashes, are plain **files**.

We can also use `ls` to see the contents of a different directory. Let's take a look at the `data-shell` directory by running `ls -F Desktop`, i.e., the command `ls` with the **arguments** `-F` and `Desktop`. The second argument --- the one without a leading dash --- tells ls that we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:  

```{bash}
cd /work/ZHU
ls -F data-shell
```

Your output should be a list of all the files and sub-directories in the `data-shell` directory you downloaded at the start of the lesson.

The command to change locations is `cd` followed by a directory name to change our working directory. `cd` stands for "change directory", which is a bit misleading: the command doesn't change the directory, it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.

Let's say we want to move to the `data` directory we saw above. We can use the following series of commands to get there:

```{bash}
cd /work/ZHU
cd data-shell
cd data
```

These commands will move us from our home directory into the `data-shell` directory, then into the `data` directory. `cd` doesn't print anything, but if we run `pwd` after it, we can see that we are now in `/work/data-shell/data`. If we run `ls` without arguments now, it lists the contents of `/work/data-shell/data`, because that's where we now are:
