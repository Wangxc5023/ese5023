# 1. More Linux commands

In this exercise, we will learn more Linux commands. Remember to use `man` to learn about different options of a command. 

**1.1** Print the calendar of 2020-11 and 2020-12 using `cal`.

**1.2** Print current UTC time and date using `date`.

**1.3** Print current UTC time using `date`, `|`, and `cut`.

**1.4** What does `top` do? [Hint: you can always use `Ctrl+x` to quit a process]

**1.5** How does `rm -r` differ from `rmdir`?

**1.6** Type `sleep 3`, explain what happens.

**1.7** Go to `~`, figure out what `watch -n 3 'date'` does.

**1.8** Go to `data_demo`, type `ls data > log1` twice, and `ls data >> log2` twice, compare `log1` and `log2`.

**1.9** Can you figure out what is the difference between `>` and `>>`?

**1.10** Use `module avail` to check installed softwares (modules) on TaiYi. Then choose one to load using `module load`.

# 2. Run an R script on TaiYi

Write a simple R script, name it as `test.R`. Then load `R` module on TaiYi using `module load R`.

Try the following two ways of running `test.R`:

* Type `R` to enter the R Console, change the working directory, then type `source test.R`.

* In the Linux environment, type `Rscript test.R`. 

# 3. Loop

The general form of a BASH loop goes like:

```{bash, eval=F}
for thing in list_of_things
do
    operation_using $thing
done
```

For example, the following lines would print the first line of each `*.pdb` file in `data_demo/data/pdb/`:

```{bash, eval=F}
for file in *.pdb
do
    cat $file | head -n 1
done
```

Can you print file size (in bytes) of each `*.pdb` file, line by line?

# 4. Environment Variables

An *environment variable* is a dynamic-named value containing information about your login session, set configuration options, and customize the shell environment in Linux-based operating systems. In simple terms, an environment variable is used to define a location for storing a value, you can also refer to with its symbolic name. These values are stored within the system and are used by command-line applications. The stored value can be deleted, displayed, edited and re-saved.

**4.1** Use `printenv` to print all environment variables.

**4.2** You can set a temporary environment variable by:

```{bash, eval=F}
MY_NAME=TAIYI
```

Then call this variable as `$MY_NAME`, for example:

```{bash, eval=F}
echo $MY_NAME
```

Notice that the above environment variables are available only for the current session. If you open a new shell, or if you log out, all variables will be lost. 

Please verify this.

**4.3** Setting a Persistent Environment Variable

One way to set a persistent environment variable is to use the user-based configuration file `.bash_profile` in your home directory. With Bash, you can declare the variables in the following format:

```{bash, eval=F}
export MY_NAME=TAIYI
```

Please add the above line to your `.bash_profile`, then save `.bash_profile`.

To update current environment variables, run:

```{bash, eval=F}
source .bash_profile
```

Now, we have made `$MY_NAME` a persistent environment variable, and it will be loaded every time you log in.
