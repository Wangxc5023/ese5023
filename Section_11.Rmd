# `Python` environments

`Python` and nearly all of the software packages in the scientific `Python` ecosystem are **open-source**. They are maintained and developed by a community of scientists and programmers, some of whose work is supported by universities, non-profits, and for-profit corporations. Because there is no single authority that controls all of these packages, coordinating the compatibility between these different packages and their multiple versions used to be a nightmare.

Sometimes when we create software, the software needs to run on a **specific version** of `Python` because our software expects a certain behavior that is present in older versions but changes in newer versions. Likewise, we may need to use specific versions of the libraries for similar reasons. But we may have many projects on our computer, perhaps a project that runs on with `xarray` version `0.1` and `Python 2.7` and even a more modern project that runs on `xarray` version `0.8` and `Python 3.8`. If we try running both at once on `Python 2.7` or `Python 3.8`, one of them may break because some of the code that runs on `Python 2` doesn’t run on `Python 3` or vice versa. This is where virtual **environments** become useful.

Virtual environments keep these dependencies in separate "sandboxes" so you can switch between both applications easily and get them running. `Python` environments take care of most of the dependencies and modules for us, but we will have to get our hands dirty in `Python` and deal with the environments. 

In this section, we will learn how to use `conda` to manage a `Python` environment ("sandbox") we play in.

## Creating a `Python` environment

`Python` coupled with a package manager provides a way to make isolated, reproducible environments where you have fine-tuned control overall packages and configuration. From now on, you are highly recommended to work within an environment, rather than the "default" environment. 

To see all the environments on your system, type the following in `Anaconda Powershell Prompt`:

```{bash, eval=F}
conda info --envs
```

This command should display the current environments, with `*` marking the environment you are in.

To quickly create an environment (called `cper`, standing for *Computing and Programming for Environmental Research*) using `conda`, type the following in `Anaconda Powershell Prompt`:

```{bash, eval=F}
conda create --name cper python=3.8.8
```

In this command, the `python=3.8.8` portion specifies which version of `Python` you want to set up the environment in; you can change the version to whatever suits your needs. Here `--name` sets the name of the environment. In other snippets you see online, you may see `--n` instead of `--name`; they mean exactly the same thing. 

Now display the current environments with `conda info --envs`, you will something like this:

```{bash, eval=F}
base                   * C:\Users\86133\anaconda3
cper                     C:\Users\86133\anaconda3\envs\cper
```

## Using a `Python` environment

After confirming that you created the environment, let's now actually use it. We can accomplish this by typing:

```{bash, eval=F}
conda activate cper
```

At this point, your terminal prompt should look something like this:

```{bash, eval=F}
(cper) PS C:\Users\86133>
```

Now display the current environments with `conda info --envs`, you will something like this:

```{bash, eval=F}
base                     C:\Users\86133\anaconda3
cper                   * C:\Users\86133\anaconda3\envs\cper
```

The `*` indicates that we are in the `cper` environment.

To get a complete summary of all the packages installed in an environment, the channel they were installed from, and their full version info, type:

```{bash, eval=F}
conda list
```

To stop using the `cper` environment, type in:

```{bash, eval=F}
conda deactivate cper
```

## Installing modules under a `Python` environment

Once you have a basic `Python` environment, you can easily add or remove modules using the `conda` command-line utility. `Conda` was created to help manage the complex dependencies and pre-compiled binary libraries that are necessary in scientific python. If you set up your python environment using the `Anaconda` Python Distribution or with `miniconda`, you should already have the `conda` command available on the command line. With it, you can easily install modules from an official, curated set of packages which are built and tested for a number of different system configurations on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

To install a module (say `XXXX`), first activate the environment (say `cper`) under which you would like to install it:

```{bash, eval=F}
conda activate cper
```

Then type:

```{bash, eval=F}
conda install XXXX
```

Additionally, there is a community-maintained collection of packages/recipes called [conda forge](https://conda-forge.org/) which is accessible through `conda` as a special "channel":

```{bash, eval=F}
conda install -c conda-forge XXXX
```

While `conda` allows you to install almost any science-related package, there may be other general-use python packages you wish to you that are not available via `conda`. For these, you can use an alternative installation method.

Outside of the scientific python community, the most common way to install packages is to search for them on the [official `PyPI` index](https://pypi.org/). Once you've found the package you want to install (you may have also just found it on Github or elsewhere), you use the `pip` command from the command line:

```{bash, eval=F}
pip install XXXX
```

If you can't find a package on either `PyPI` or `conda-forge`, you can always install it directly from the source code. If the package is on `github`, `pip` already has an alias to do this for you:

```{bash, eval=F}
pip install git+https://github.com/.../XXXX.git
```

Where `https://github.com/.../XXXX.git` indicates the url of the module.

Now let's install some modules under the `cper` environment. Make sure you have activated the `cper` environment; otherwise, modules will be installed under the `base` environment.

First, we will install modules via `conda`:

```{bash, eval=F}
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib netCDF4 xarray notebook cartopy dask python-graphviz
```

Later, we use `pip` to install a module via a different channel:

```{bash, eval=F}
pip install nc-time-axis
```

Now use `conda list` to verify that we have successfully installed the above modules.

## Using the environment file

As you type `conda list`, you get a complete summary of all the modules installed in your environment, the channel they were installed from, and their full version info. Using this info, you are able to create an environment file in [`YAML` syntax](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) (YAML Ain’t Markup Language) which documents the exact contents of your environment. 

To export your current environment (`cper`) to a `yml` file (`my_environment.yml`):

```{bash, eval=F}
conda env export --name cper > my_environment.yml
```

The `>` indicates that the output is writing to a file called `my_environment.yml`. If there were any contents in `my_environment.yml` before this command, they would be overwritten. Now in your working directory, a file `my_environment.yml` was just created, open it, you will see a list of configurations of the `cper` environment. 

The environment file (`my_environment.yml`) is very useful, as it allows creating an **identical** environment. You can use different environment files for different projects, or share an environment file with someone to grantee **reproducible research**.

To create a new environment (say `cper_new`) through existing environment file (say `ZZZZ.yml`), go to the folder that contains this environment file, type:

```{bash, eval=F}
conda env create --name cper_new --file ZZZZ.yml
```

## Packaging a conda environment 

If you want to copy the environment, you may want to use `conda-pack` that allows you to package your entire environment as a compressed file (a `tar.gz`) you can just copy and paste somewhere, and it just works. 

Pack your environment: 

```{bash, eval=F}
conda pack
```

It can take some minutes depending on the size of the environment and the number of libraries installed. Move the compressed file to the destination, Uncompress the environment in the folder, then Run:

```{bash, eval=F}
conda-unpack 
```

to re-create symlinks and set everything up. Check [Moving Conda Environments](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/moving-conda-environments) for more.

## Removing a conda environment 

If you would like to get rid of the entire `cper` environment, deactivate it then type in:

```{bash, eval=F}
conda remove --name cper --all
```

The `--all` flag is to remove all packages from the environment and is necessary to completely clean the environment.
