# 1. Building a guessing game

+ Set a secret integer from `0` to `9`, name the integer `answer`. Make sure your deskmate does not know the secret number.

+ Write a function that does the following: if your deskmate is able to guess your secret number correctly within `3` tries, print `You Win!`, otherwise print `You Lose! I Win!`

+ Let your deskmate play the game. 

+ Now it's your turn to play your deskmate's game.

[Hint: consider creating a module and later import it]

# 2. Rock, paper, and scissors

In this mini-project, we will build a rock, paper, scissors game in the following steps:

+ Define a list `["rock", "paper", "scissors"]`, use `choice()` function from `random` module to randomly select an element from the list, name it `computer_choice`.

+ Write a `while` loop to ask for user input. The loop should ask for a new input if the previous input value is not in the list. Name the input `your_choice`.

+ Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to determine who wins.

# 3. Using `Jupyter Notebook`

Jupyter is a loose acronym meaning `Julia`, `Python`, and `R`. The word "notebook" denotes documents that contain **both code and rich text elements**, such as figures, links, equations, etc. Because of the mix of code and text elements, these documents are the ideal place to bring together an analysis description, and its results, as well as, they can be executed perform the data analysis in real time.

`Jupyter` is a free, open-source, interactive web tool known as a computational notebook, which researchers can use to combine software code, computational output, explanatory text and multimedia resources in a single document. Jupyter is recommended by *Nature* as [data scientists’ computational notebook of choice](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1). 

+ `Jupyter` is installed along with `Anaconda`. Open `Anaconda Powershell Prompt (anaconda3)`, change working directory using `cd`. 

+ Type and run `jupyter notebook`. This will open your default web browser, and Jupyter dashboard will show up.

+ Create a new note by clicking `New` then `Python3 (ipykernel)`.

+ Go over `User Interface Tour` under the `Help` tab to familiarize yourself with the layout.

+ Feel free to look around, refer to [Python For Data Science Cheat Sheet Jupyter Notebook](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese5023/download/python-cheatsheets_Jupyter.pdf) if you have any questions.

+ Copy the following lines to a cell, run the cell, see what happens. We will take a closer look at `matplotlib` in the next section.

```{python, eval=F}
# import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Get some data
temperatrue = [15.4,16.3,19.0,22.7,26.0,28.0,
               28.9,28.7,27.7,25.3,21.2,17.0]
month = range(1,13)

# Plot a line
plt.plot(month, temperatrue)

# Add x and y labels
plt.xlabel("Month")
plt.ylabel("Temperature")

# Add figure title
plt.title("Monthly mean temperature in Shenzhen")

# Show plot
plt.show
```

To convert a notebook file (e.g., `xxx.ipynb`) to a `python` file (e.g., `xxx.py`), open `Anaconda Powershell Prompt (anaconda3)`, change to the path contains the notebook file, type: 

`ipython nbconvert --to script xxx.ipynb`
