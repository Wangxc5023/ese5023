**Overview:**   
Computing is an indispensable tool for Environmental scientists. Being able to analyze and visualize data sets through programming efforts precisely has become one of the most critical skills for carrying out studies in Environmental Science. However, incoming ESE graduate students often find their opportunities to get access to such courses limited at SUSTech. This course will introduce students to modern computing softwares, programming tools, and practice that are broadly applicable in their later research. This course will include an introduction to Linux, version control and data backup, programming in two commonly used languages (FORTRAN and R), data analysis and visualization tools, and high-performance computing exercises on cluster computers. This course will boost studentsâ€™ programming and computing skills, which are in high demand in the era of Big Data. This course is a **hands-on and project-oriented** course that facilitates student learning through lectures, in-class exercises, assignments, final project, and one-on-one interactions. All topics will be taught through example data sets, demos, and research problems from Environmental Science.  

**Structure:**   
The course will meet on Thursday weekly, and on Tuesday every other week (odd week only). On Thursday, new material will be presented by the instructor followed by in-class exercises. On Tuesday, the class will trun into a workshop - one group (2-3 students) will be selected randomly to present their assignment in progress. Tuesday class time will be devoted to discussing their project, interactive in-class work on the assignment, and one-on-one interactions between students and the instructor.

**Textbook:**   
There is no required textbook. Readings will be freely available from online resources made available through the course website.

**Laptop:**   
Students are required to have a laptop available to bring to class to learning the material and work on the assignments. Students are encouraged to check [resources](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese5023/Resource.html) for softwares/tools used in the course.

**Grading:**   
Students will be evaluated at the end of the semester based on their assignments (40%), assignment presentation (20%), and final project (40%).
