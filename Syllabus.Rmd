**TA: TBD**  


**Class Time:** Tuesday (odd week only) / Thursday, 19:00-21:00

**Location:** 401, Teaching Building 1

**Credit:** The course has a credit of 3.0, with a total class hours of 48

**Overview:** Computing is an indispensable tool for Environmental scientists. Being able to analyze and visualize data sets through programming efforts precisely has become one of the most critical skills for carrying out studies in Environmental Science. However, incoming ESE graduate students often find their opportunities to get access to such courses limited at SUSTech. This course will introduce students to modern computing software, programming tools, and practices that are broadly applicable in their later research. This course will include an introduction to Unix, version control and data backup, programming in two commonly used languages (FORTRAN and R), data analysis and visualization tools, and high-performance computing exercises on cluster computers. This course will boost students’ programming and computing skills, which are in high demand in the era of Big Data. This course is a project-oriented, hands-on course that facilitates student learning through lectures, in-class exercises, homework, final project, and one-on-one interaction during office hours. All topics will be taught through example data sets, demos, and research problems from Environmental Science.

**Course Structure:** The course will meet twice a week. New material will be presented by the instructors on Thursday, with an assignment due the following week (students will work in pairs). On Tuesday, the classroom will be “flipped”: one group will be selected randomly to present their assignment in progress. Tuesday class time will be devoted to discussing / critiquing their work, interactive in-class work on the assignment, and one-on-one interaction between students and instructors.

**Textbook:** There is no required textbook. Readings will be freely available from online resources made available through the course website.

**Computers:** Students are required to have a laptop available to bring to class to work on the assignments and learning the material. Students will also be given an educational account on the Taiyi cluster computer. [Softwares](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese5023/software.html) used in the course are provided.

**Grading:** Students will be evaluated at the end of the semester based on their homework (bi-weekly, 30%), oral presentation (30%), term paper (30%), and class participation (10%).
