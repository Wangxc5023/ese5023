# SSH Client Tools
You need to have the Secure Shell (SSH), which is a network protocol that enables you to connect to Linux and Unix servers over the network. It uses public key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer. You can use SSH by several ways, either by using it automatically or by using a password authentication to log in. Here are some SSH clients let you connect to your Linux servers. 

* Windows:
[MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net), [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty),   [Xshell](https://www.netsarang.com/en/xshell)
