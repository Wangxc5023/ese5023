# Introduction to `Python` (continued)

## Set

A `set` is an **unordered** collection data type that is **unchangeable** and **does not allow duplicate values**. Pythonâ€™s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set. The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set. 

```{python, eval=F}
# Create a set
Pollutants = {"PM10", "PM2.5", "O3", "CO", "SO2", "NO2"}
print(Pollutants) 

# A set is a collection that is both unordered and unindexed
Pollutants[0]

# Once a set is created, you cannot change its items
Pollutants[0] = "VOCs"
```

Here are some functions to handle a set:

```{python, eval=F}
# Update a set
New_pollutants = {"VOCs", "PAH"}
Pollutants.update(New_pollutants)
print(Pollutants)

# Remove an item using remove
Pollutants.remove("PAH")
print(Pollutants)

# Remove an item using discard
Pollutants.discard("VOCs")
print(Pollutants)
```

For more functions, please refer to [Built-in Types - Set Types](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#set).

## Dictionary

Finally, a dictionary is a collection which is **ordered**, changeable and does not allow duplicates. Dictionaries are used to store data values in `key: value` **pairs**. Let's define a `dictionary` for the `6` air pollutants as follow:

```{python, eval=F}
# Create and print a dictionary:
Air_pollutants = {
  "PM10": "Inhalable particles",
  "PM2.5": "Fine particulate matter",
  "O3": "Ozone",
  "CO": "Carbon monoxide",
  "SO2": "Sulfur dioxide",
  "NO2": "Nitrogen dioxide",
}
print(Air_pollutants) 
```

Dictionary items can be referred to by using the key name:

```{python, eval=F}
print(Air_pollutants["CO"])
```

The key and value are not necessarily at `string` type. Numbers also work.

```{python, eval=F}
# Key and value can be other types
Air_pollutants = {
  "PM10": "Inhalable particles",
  "PM2.5": "Fine particulate matter",
  "O3": "Ozone",
  "CO": "Carbon monoxide",
  "SO2": "Sulfur dioxide",
  "NO2": "Nitrogen dioxide",
  100:   "The number 100",
  "Density": 1.69
}

Air_pollutants[100]
Air_pollutants["Density"]

# Show all keys
Air_pollutants.keys()

# Show all values
Air_pollutants.values()

# Get the value
Air_pollutants.get("SO2")
Air_pollutants.get("PO2")

# If key is not found, return default value
Air_pollutants.get("PO2", "Not a valid key")

```

Some functions to handle a dictionary:

```{python, eval=F}
# Change the value
Air_pollutants["Density"] = 1.99
Air_pollutants

# Add a new item
Air_pollutants[200] = "The number 200"
Air_pollutants

# Remove an item with pop()
Air_pollutants.pop(200)
Air_pollutants

# Remove an item with del
del Air_pollutants["Density"]
Air_pollutants
```

For more functions, please refer to [Built-in Types - Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries).

## Summary of types

So far, we have covered all `4` built-in data types in `Python` to store collections of data: `list`, `tuple`, `set`, and `dictionary`. Here is a quick summary:

Type|Ordered|Changeable|Allow duplicate members|How to define|
|:--|:------|:---------|:----------------------|:------------|
|List |  Y  |     Y    | Y                     | `[ ]`       |
|Tuple|  Y  |     N    | Y                     | `( )`       |
|Set  |  N  |     N    | N                     | `{ }`       |
|Dictionary |  Y (as of v3.7)  |     Y    | N         | `{ }` with key       |

## `while` loop

With the `while` loop, we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

```{python, eval=F}
# Initialize the ID
ID = 0

# while loop, print the first 5 numbers
while ID < 5 :
    print(ID)
    ID = ID + 1
    # Another way to write the increment 
    # ID += 1
```

The code can be translated as: As long as `ID` is less than `5`, `python` will print `ID` and then increase it by `1`. Now can you figure out what is `ID` after the `while` loop?

You can also use the `else` statement to run a block of code once when the condition is no longer true. For example:

```{python, eval=F}
# Initialize the ID
ID = 0

# while loop, print the first 5 numbers
while ID < 5 :
    print(ID)
    ID = ID + 1
# if the condition is no longer true, do following
else:
    print("ID is beyond 4, ID = " + str(ID))
```

Even more, you can use `break` and `continue` combined with `if` statement to control the flow.

```{python, eval=F}
# use break and continue to control the flow
  
# Initialize the ID
ID = 0

# while loop, print the first 5 numbers
while ID < 5 :
    print(ID)
    ID = ID + 1
    # use continue
    if ID == 2 :
        print("ID becomes 2 now")
        continue
    # use break
    if ID == 3 :
        print("Breaks with ID = 3")
        break
# if the condition is no longer true, do following
else:
    print("ID is beyond 4, ID = " + str(ID))
```

## `for` loop

A `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (i.e. list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).

Let's use `for` loop to print each element in a collection:

```{python, eval=F}
# Loop element in a collection (list, tuple, dict, and set)
for x in Air_pollutants:
    print(x)
```

This also works for a `string`:

```{python, eval=F}
# for loop also works for a string
for letter in "ESE5023":
    print(letter)
```

Similar to the `while` loop, one can use `for` combined with `break`, `continue`, and `if` to control the flow:

```{python, eval=F}
# for loop with if, break, and continue
for letter in "ESE5023":
    if letter == "E":
        print(letter.lower())
        continue
    else:
        print(letter)
    if letter == "5":
        break
```

To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the `range()` function, which returns a sequence of numbers, starting from `0` by default, and increments by `1` (by default), and ends at a specified number.

```{python, eval=F}
# for loop with range, starting from 0
for i in range(5):
    print(i)        

# for loop with range, starting from 1
for i in range(1,5):
    print(i)    

# for loop with range, starting from 1, increment 2
for i in range(1,5,2):
    print(i)   
```

Finally, you can run nested `for` loop:

```{python, eval=F}
# nested for loop
for letter in "ESE5023":
    for i in range(3):
        print(letter)
```

## Modules

A `module` allows you to logically organize your `Python` code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. A `module` is a `Python` object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference. Simply, a `module` is **a file consisting of `Python` code**. A module can define functions, classes, and variables. 

For example, copy the following lines and save the file as `my_module.py` to your working directory.

```{python, eval=F}
# Create a function to print say hi
def say_hi():
    name = input("Please type you name: ")
    print("Hello " + name)

# Also define some variables
age = 28
gender = "Male"
```

To import `my_module.py`:
```{python, eval=F}
import my_module
```

We can then use functions and variables defined in the above module:

```{python, eval=F}
# Does this work?
say_hi()

# Call a function from the imported module
my_module.say_hi()

# Call a variable from the imported module
my_module.age
```

`Python` provides a range of official modules to do various tasks, see [Python Module](https://docs.python.org/3.8/py-modindex.html) for the comprehensive list. For example, we previously imported `ramdom` module to generate random values:

```{python, eval=F}
# import python official modules
import random
random.random()
```

As we are using `Python` from `Anaconda`, official module files are located at: `C:\Users\xxx\anaconda3\Lib`, where `xxx` is your user name.

`Python` also has a huge collection of third-party modules available for you to install. To do so, we use a package manager called `pip` (Pip Installs Packages). 

* Open `Anaconda Prompt (anaconda3)`

* Type `pip install yyy`, where `yyy` is the package name (for example `python-docx`)

* The new package will be installed at `C:\Users\xxx\anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\`, where `xxx` is your user name.

* To uninstall the package `yyy`, type `pip uninstall yyy`.

# In-class exercises

## Exercise #1 Fibonacci series

Use `for` loop to display Fibonacci series up to `100` terms.

## Exercise #2 Building a number translator

Build a translator that first asks a user to input a string, then converts every number in the string to `*`, and finally prints the result.

[Hint: you may find the keyword `in` useful]

## Exercise #3 Building a guessing game (v2)

+ Set a secret integer from `0` to `9`, name the integer `answer`. Make sure your deskmate does not know the secret number.

+ Write a function that does the following: if your deskmate is able to guess your secret number correctly within `3` tries, print `You Win!`, otherwise print `You Lose! I Win!`

+ Let your deskmate play the game. 

+ Now it's your turn to play your deskmate's game.

[Hint: consider creating a module and later import it]
