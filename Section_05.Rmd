# Prerequisites

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Load the libraries:
```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Tidy data

In this section, we will learn a consistent way to organise the data in R, called **tidy data**. Getting the data into this format requires some upfront work, but that work pays off in the long term. Once you have tidy data and the tools provided by the `tidyr`, `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages, you will spend much less time munging/wrangling data from one representation to another, allowing you to spend more time on the analytic questions at hand.

## Tibble

For now, we will use `tibble` instead of R’s traditional `data.frame`. Tibble is data frame, but they tweak some older behaviours to make life a little easier. 

Let's use `Keeling_Data` as an example:

```{r}
Keeling_Data <- read.csv(file = "co2_mm_mlo.csv", header = T)
head(Keeling_Data)
```

You can coerce a `data.frame` to a `tibble` using the `as_tibble()` function:

```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl <- as_tibble(Keeling_Data)
Keeling_Data_tbl
```

## Tidy dataset

There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

* Each variable must have its own column;
* Each observation must have its own row;
* Each value must have its own cell;

<img src="figs/tidy-1.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>

These three rules are interrelated because it’s impossible to only satisfy two of the three. That interrelationship leads to an even simpler set of practical instructions:

* Put each dataset in a tibble
* Put each variable in a column

Why ensure that your data is tidy? There are two main advantages:

* There’s a general advantage to picking one consistent way of storing data. If you have **a consistent data structure**, it’s easier to learn the tools that work with it because they have an underlying uniformity. If you ensure that your data is tidy, you’ll spend less time fighting with the tools and more time working on your analysis.

* There’s a specific advantage to placing variables in columns because it allows R’s vectorised nature to shine. That makes transforming tidy data feel particularly natural. `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and `ggplot2` are designed to work with tidy data.

# The `dplyr` package

The `dplyr` package provides a number of very useful functions for manipulating dataframes in a way that will reduce the self-repetition, reduce the probability of making errors, and probably even save you some typing. As an added bonus, you might even find the dplyr grammar easier to read.

Here we’re going to cover 5 of the most commonly used functions as well as using pipes `%>%` to combine them.

## Using `select()`

Use the `select()` function to keep only the variables (cplumns) you select.

```{r}
select(Keeling_Data_tbl,year,co2,quality)
select(Keeling_Data_tbl,co2)
```

## The pipe symbol `%>%`

Above we used ‘normal’ grammar, but the strengths of `dplyr` and `tidyr` lie in combining several functions using **pipes**. Since the pipes grammar is unlike anything we’ve seen in R before, let’s repeat what we’ve done above using pipes.

```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl %>% 
  select(year,co2,quality)
```

The above lines mean we first call the `Keeling_Data_tbl` tibble and pass it on, using the **pipe symbol** `%>%`, to the next step, which is the `select()` function. In this case, we don’t specify which **data object** we use in the `select()` function since in gets that from the previous pipe. The `select()` function then takes what it gets from the pipe, in this case the `Keeling_Data_tbl` tibble, as its *1st argument*. You will see the power of `pipe` as script lines increase.

## Using `filter()`

Use `filter()` to get values (cells):
```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl %>% 
  filter(year == 2000)
```

If we now want to move forward with the above tibble, but only with `quality == 1` , we can combine `select()` and `filter()` functions:

```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl %>% 
  select(year,co2,quality) %>% 
  filter(quality == 1)
```

You see here we have used the pipe twice, and the scripts become really clean and easy to follow. 

## Using `group_by()` and `summarize()`

Now try to 'group' monthly data using the `group_by()` function, notice how the ouput tibble changes:

```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl %>% 
  select(year,month,co2,quality) %>% 
  filter(quality == 1) %>% 
  group_by(month)
```

The `group_by()` function is much more exciting in conjunction with the  `summarize()` function. This will allow us to create new variable(s) by using functions that repeat for each of the continent-specific data frames. That is to say, using the `group_by()` function, we **split our original dataframe into multiple pieces**, then we can run functions (e.g. `mean()` or `sd()`) within `summarize()`.

```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl %>% 
  select(year,month,co2,quality) %>% 
  filter(quality == 1) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(month_mean = mean(co2))
```
Here we create a new variable (column) `month_mean`, and append it to the groups (month in this case). Now, we get a so-called *climatology*.

You can also use `arrange()` and `desc()` to sort the data: 
```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl %>% 
  select(year,month,co2,quality) %>% 
  filter(quality == 1) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(month_mean = mean(co2)) %>% 
  arrange(month_mean)
```

```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl %>% 
  select(year,month,co2,quality) %>% 
  filter(quality == 1) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(month_mean = mean(co2)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(month_mean))
```

Let's add more statistics:
```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl %>% 
  select(year,month,co2,quality) %>% 
  filter(quality == 1) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(month_mean = mean(co2), moth_sd = sd(co2),
            month_min = min(co2), month_max = max(co2),
            month_se = sd(co2)/sqrt(n()))
```
Here we call the `n()` to get the size of a vector.

## Using mutate()

We can also create new variables (columns) using the `mutate()` function:

```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl %>% 
  mutate(co2_ppt = co2 * 1e3)
```

When creating new variables, we can hook this with a logical condition. A simple combination of `mutate()` and `ifelse()` facilitates filtering right where it is needed: in the moment of creating something new. This easy-to-read statement is a fast and powerful way of discarding certain data or for updating values depending on this given condition.

```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl %>% 
  mutate(co2_ppt = co2 * 1e3, co2_new = ifelse(quality==1, co2, NA))
```

## Combining `dplyr` and `ggplot2`

Just as we used `%>%` to pipe data along a chain of `dplyr` functions we can use it to pass data to `ggplot()`. Because `%>%` replaces the first argument in a function we don’t need to specify the `data = argument` in the `ggplot()` function. 

By combining `dplyr` and `ggplot2` functions we can make figures without creating any new variables or modifying the data.

```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl %>% 
  mutate(co2_new = ifelse(quality==1, co2, NA)) %>% 
  # Make the plot
  ggplot(aes(x=decimal_date, y=co2_new)) + 
  geom_line()
```
As you will see, this is much easier than what we have done in [Section 3](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese5023/Section_03.html) This is the power of a tidy dataset and its related functions!

Now let's plot monthly CO~2~ with the `color` option:
```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl %>% 
  mutate(co2_new = ifelse(quality==1, co2, NA)) %>% 
  # Make the plot
  ggplot(aes(x=decimal_date, y=co2_new, color=month)) + 
  geom_line()
```

Or plot the data in panels with the `facet_wrap` function:
```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl %>% 
  mutate(co2_new = ifelse(quality==1, co2, NA)) %>% 
  # Make the plot
  ggplot(aes(x=decimal_date, y=co2_new, color=month)) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ month)
```

# The `tidyr` package

<img src="figs/14-tidyr-fig1.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

The ‘long’ layout or format is where:

* each column is a variable
* each row is an observation

For the ‘wide’ format each row is often a site/subject/patient and you have multiple observation variables containing the same type of data. These can be either repeated observations over time, or observation of multiple variables (or a mix of both). 

You may find data input may be simpler or some other applications may prefer the ‘wide’ format. However, many of R’s functions have been designed assuming you have ‘longer’ formatted data. 

Here we use `tidyr` package to efficiently transform the data shape regardless of original format.

'Long' and 'wide' layouts mainly affect readability. For humans, the 'wide' format is often more intuitive since we can often see more of the data on the screen due to its shape. However, the 'long' format is more machine readable and is closer to the formatting of databases.

## Long to wide format with `spread()`

Spread rows into columns:
```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl_wide <- Keeling_Data_tbl %>% 
  select(year,month,co2) %>% 
  spread(month, co2) 
Keeling_Data_tbl_wide
```

## Wide to long format with `gather()`

Gather columns into rows:
```{r}
Keeling_Data_tbl_2000 <- Keeling_Data_tbl_wide %>% 
  filter(year == 2000) %>% 
  gather("MONTH","co2") 
Keeling_Data_tbl_2000
```
